 * Moved test for Linux into Build.PL and die with the correct error string so
   automated things (e.g. CPAN Testers) give up on other platforms.
 
 * Switched license from BSD to Perl.
 
 * Use H2PM to find the correct ioctl numbers at compile time rather than
   executing hardcoded ones and hoping for the best.
 
 * Use H2PM to get the ext2 flag constants. The ext3/4 constants are still
   included as the ext3/4 headers don't seem to be available in userland.
 
 * Removed some unused and undocumented things.
